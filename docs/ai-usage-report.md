# AI Usage Report (Assignment 1)

## Tools Used & Use Cases
### Tool 1: ChatGPT
- Used for: generating starter HTML/CSS/JS structure, theme toggle logic, and documentation templates.
- Why: to speed up scaffolding and learn best practices (semantic HTML, accessibility basics, responsive layout).

## Benefits & Challenges
### Benefits
- Helped me create a clean folder structure and plan features that match the rubric.
- Helped me debug small issues (missing IDs, wrong file paths, etc.).

### Challenges / Limitations
- Some generated code needed adjustments to match my file structure.
- I had to double-check accessibility and make sure I understood the JavaScript logic.

## Learning Outcomes
- I learned how to:
  - Organize a front-end project into HTML/CSS/JS folders
  - Use CSS variables for theming
  - Use localStorage for saving user preferences
  - Write clearer README and technical docs

## Responsible Use & Modifications
- I reviewed all AI output line-by-line.
- I renamed variables and simplified parts I didn’t understand.
- I tested features in the browser and fixed issues (paths, layout, responsiveness).
- I ensured the final result reflects  my understanding and matches the rubric requirements.
I treated AI suggestions as drafts, not final answers. I tested all generated code,
rewrote parts in my own words, and ensured the final structure reflected my understanding.
