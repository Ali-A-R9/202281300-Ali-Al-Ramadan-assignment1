# Assignment 1 – Foundation & AI Integration  
## Personal Portfolio Website

This project is a responsive personal portfolio website developed as part of a web development course assignment. The goal of this assignment was to build a clean foundation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while responsibly integrating AI-assisted development tools.

The website represents the starting point of my professional portfolio and will be expanded in later assignments.
